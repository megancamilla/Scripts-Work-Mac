For each de novo contig

make dictionary with genes found on each contig (Top BLAST 50%)

make second dictionary with reference genes and location on ref genome.


use gene name as a key to list both original location on ref and new location in de novo

output list of genes for each de novo contig > 10,000 bp look for de novo contigs with genes from diff chromosomes

will this show any hyper variable regions?
